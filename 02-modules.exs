# The most efficient way to find the number is to guess halfway between the low
# and high numbers of the range. If our guess is too big, then the answer lies
# between the bottom of the range and one less than our guess. If our guess is
# too small, then the answer lies between one more than our guess and the end of
# the range.
#
# Your output should look similar to this:
#
# iex> Chop.guess(273, 1..1000)
# Is it 500
# Is it 250
# Is it 375
# Is it 312
# Is it 281
# Is it 265
# Is it 273
# 273
#
# Hints:
# You may need to implement helper functions with an additional parameter (the
# currently guessed number).
# The div(a,b) function performs integer division.
# Guard clauses are your friends.
# Patterns can match the low and high parts of a range (a..b=4..8).‚Äù
